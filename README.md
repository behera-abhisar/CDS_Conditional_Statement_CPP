# CDS_Conditional_Statement_CPP

In this experiment, I explored how conditional statements like if, if-else, and switch work in C++. I learned how these statements help control the flow of a program based on different conditions. By writing and testing various conditions, I understood how decisions are made in code and how different branches are executed depending on the input.
